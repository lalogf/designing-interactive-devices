The point of this week's lab is to figure out a cool interaction that you can make possible with the a micro controller which can record data generated by a sensor, and then play it back.

- Each time you open a fridge
- Each time you drink water bottle
- Counts how many seconds you have an open water faucett and makes a sound after 20 secs
- Detects when you blow a sensor and turns and changes light color with intensity
- Detect how ground moves to calculate earthquake magnitude
- Detect how fast and accurate can you follow on screen instruction (guitar hero)
